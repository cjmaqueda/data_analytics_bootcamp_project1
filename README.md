Project Title: US Avocado Market, and Associated Relationships

We propose to use avocado data, reported by the Haas Avocado Company, to evaluate the following:

•	Avocado sales volumes and sales prices, across differing types (e.g. organic vs. conventional) 
•	Sales and prices across distinct markets/regions 

The main focus of the analysis centers on understanding the elasticity of demand for avocados in the US as well as explaining price fluctuations within the US avocado market.

The project will start with an exploratory data analysis of geographic sales volumes and how they have changed over time in relation to price change, utilizing data from 2015 through 2018. 

Additionally, we will explore how avocado price changes due to supply chain disruptions.
