We propose to use water quality data reported by the US Environmental Protection Agency to explore water quality data and explore how water quality impacts economic and health outcomes across the US. We will to focus on concentrations of nitrates, lead, mercury, flouride, cholrine, and arsenic in water measured from 2006-2011. The project will start with an exploratory data analysis of geographic concentrations of these contaminants and how they have changed over time. We will then explore how water contamination impacts mortality data and how economic outcomes and activity impact water quality.
